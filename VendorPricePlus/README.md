# Vendor Price Plus
A World of Warcraft: Classic (Anniversary, Seasons, Hardcore, Era) addon that displays the vendor price and Stack price of items when not at a vendor.

Vendor Price Plus includes the core functionality of the popular Vendor Price addon by Ketho17, displaying the price of an item when not at a vendor, as well as the stack price. I have enjoyed the Vendor Price addon for several years, but I've alaways resorted to doing the per unit math in my head when listing items at the auction house. Similar addons create a lot of bulk to the item tooltip and I wanted something minimally invasive to the default UI. Now plays nice with the Auctionator addon if the player has it installed and enabled as well.

<h4>Features</h4>

- Lists the vendor price per unit in the item tooltip as Vendor
- Lists the vendor stack price in the item tooltip as Stack
- Integrates seamlessly with the default Blizzard UI
- Plays nice with [Auctionator](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auctionator) and matches its neat tooltip format

<h4>Acknowledgements</h4>

-  [Vendor Price](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/vendor-price) by [Keytho17](https://legacy.curseforge.com/members/Ketho17/projects) and [Iceythe77](https://legacy.curseforge.com/members/icesythe77/projects)

<h4>Known Issues / To-Do</h4>

- Create options commands and/or window to edit/enable/disable various tooltip customizations so players can personalize the addon to their liking
- Merge functionality with another of my addons, [GreyVendorTrash](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/grey-vendor-trash), that makes poor item quality items greyscale and easily identifiable as trash
